Datatable v1.0.5
================

Datatable is a jQuery plugin for dynamic datatables with pagination, filtering and ajax loading.

How to use?
===========

Datatable is quite simple to use. Just add the CSS and Js file to your page (do not forget jquery):

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/datatable.js"></script>
```

And run:

```
$('#MyTable').datatable() ;
```

**Note:** If you use bootstrap CSS, you use `datatable-boostrap.css` instead of `datatable.css`.

The full plugin documentation is available here: http://holt59.github.io/datatable

**Warning:** If you use bootstrap 3, you need to manually set the <code>pagingListClass</code> and <code>pagingDivClass</code> options to match bootstrap 3 pagination classes.
