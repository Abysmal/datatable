Datatable v0.1 - Alpha
=========

Datatable is a jQuery / bootstrap plugin for dynamic datatables with pagination, filtering and ajax loading.

How to use?
===========

Datatable is quite simple to use. Just add the CSS and Js file to your page (do not forget jquery):
`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>  
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/datatable.js"></script>`
And run:
`$('#MyTable').datatable() ;`

If you use bootstrap CSS, you can use datatable-boostrap.css instead of datatable.css (which is just the datatable-bootstrap.css with some additional style).
